## ðŸ“– Project Overview  

An inventory management agency commissioned an analysis of product stock and historical demand data.  
The main business questions are:  

1. **Can cluster-based patterns be identified in product demand and inventory data?**  
2. **Can we predict whether a promotion should be allocated for a specific product?**  

This project applies **data exploration, preprocessing, clustering, and predictive modeling** to answer these questions.
